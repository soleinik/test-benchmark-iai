# test-benchmark-iai
Performance bugs are bugs!

## About 
This is test project that implements benchmaring of a function. This project uses [iai](https://crates.io/crates/iai) crate



## Prerequisits
To build and run this project you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Rust (latest stable) â€“ [How to install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
- Valgrind (install it with `sudo apt install valgrind`)
- Clone this repo 
```
$ git clone git@github.com:soleinik/test-benchmark-iai.git && cd test-benchmark-iai
```


## How to run
Excecute `cargo bench` in project's root folder

1. First time (for base line)
